### Hop along as I build my home NAS server.
This is probably not something you shouldn't use, and in fact I wonder
why I'm making it myself when there are working solutions out there.
The answer is: because I want to, and it will be a fun project that
I can bring up at a party for clout. Not that I get invited to parties but you get the idea. 

This will give me the opportunity to work on something more hands-on instead of making websites all the time!
